👋 Hi, I’m @ Karthik setti
🔐 I’m an IAM Engineer & Application Security Specialist with 4+ years of hands-on experience in securing enterprise applications and managing identity governance.  

👀 I’m interested in identity & access management (IAM), application security, authentication protocols (SAML, OAuth, OIDC), and automation of lifecycle management.  

🌱 I have completed  my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of North Texas and exploring advanced topics in cryptography, secure software development, and federated access.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
- SailPoint IdentityIQ configuration and automation
- Secure SSO/MFA integrations using Okta or PingFederate
- Python-based security automation and SCIM provisioning
- IAM lifecycle workflows and zero trust architecture
